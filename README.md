# Too Be Decided - The Misspelling

For a module in second year of Computer Science, Object oriented programming, we were given the option to do whatever we wanted really. I decided that I would take on a project that interested me and helped me understand a bit more about networks.<br>
The idea of the game went through various iterations such as a First person shooter or a fighting game but the background typically stayed the same. I used an API by GameSparks which made it possible for me to create an online game. 

<br><h3>Platform </h3><br>
The project was created in Unity using C# and GameSparks.

<br> <h3> Most proud of </h3> <br> 
Actually managing to get something finished. The project was a huge task which brought about so many challenges (bugs) but I'm happy to say I created an online game.
