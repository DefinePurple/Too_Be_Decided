# Too Be Decided - The Misspelling

<b> WIP </b><br>
For a module in second year of Computer Science, Object oriented programming, we were given the option to do whatever we wanted really. I decided that I would take on a project that interested me and helped me understand a bit more about networks.<br>
The idea of the game went through various iterations such as a First person shooter or a fighting game but the background typically stayed the same. I used an API by GameSparks which made it possible for me to create an online game. Even though this game is in development for an assigment, I will most likely continue the development over the summer.
